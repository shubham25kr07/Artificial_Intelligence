In question 3, use the heuristic estimate as:

Getting a coin earlier is preferable to getting the same coin again. Apply a penalty of εd to encourage early picking up of the coins, where ε is 0.0001and d is the depth at which the coin was picked.


For making an estimate, the agent that has a smaller distance to the remaining coins is preferred. So, getting closer to a coin is preferable. The heuristic function is thus difference in coins collected + 1/(m+n+1) * (distance to nearest coin for min – distance to nearest coin for max).
